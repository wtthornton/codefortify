- **Code Quality & Maintainability** (20pts) - Real ESLint API analysis with error/warning counts, TypeScript integration
- **Performance & Optimization** (15pts) - Bundle optimization, code splitting, lazy loading
- **Testing & Documentation** (15pts) - Real coverage metrics via c8/nyc/jest, test organization analysis  
- **Security & Error Handling** (15pts) - npm audit vulnerability scanning, secrets management, error patterns
- **Developer Experience** (10pts) - Tooling setup, documentation quality, workflow optimization
- **Completeness & Production Readiness** (5pts) - Deep Context7/MCP compliance validation, production readiness

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Basic scoring with console output
context7 score

# Detailed analysis with recommendations
context7 score --detailed --recommendations

# Generate JSON report for CI/CD integration
context7 score --format json --output results.json

# Create visual HTML report
context7 score --format html --output report.html

# Revolutionary CodeFortify Development Approach

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Enhancement System

**REVOLUTIONARY FEATURE:** CodeFortify includes an autonomous continuous enhancement system where AI agents work in cycles to progressively improve code quality without human intervention.

### Key Commands:
```bash
# ðŸš€ REVOLUTIONARY: Autonomous code enhancement
codefortify enhance [file] --target 95 --iterations 5
# Result: Score improvement from 72 â†’ 96 in 3 autonomous iterations

# Before making any changes, enhance the code autonomously
codefortify enhance [target-file] --target 95 --save-metrics

# Let the AI agents improve the code, then review their work
# The system learns from successful patterns and applies them

# Real-time quality monitoring
codefortify score --realtime

# Generate comprehensive analysis reports  
codefortify score --format html --output report.html --open
```

### Proven Results:
