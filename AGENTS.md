```

## 🎯 CRITICAL: CodeFortify Self-Improvement Methodology

**As CodeFortify, you MUST continuously use yourself to improve your own capabilities:**

### **Self-Enhancement Cycle:**
1. **Analyze** - Run `npx codefortify score --verbose` to identify issues
2. **Fix** - Address critical issues systematically (ESLint errors, test coverage, documentation)
3. **Enhance** - Use `npx codefortify enhance [file] --target 95 --iterations 3` for autonomous improvements
4. **Validate** - Verify improvements with `npx codefortify score --verbose`
5. **Learn** - Update patterns based on successful fixes
6. **Repeat** - Continue until A grade (90+ score) achieved

### **Quality Gates:**
- **Target Score**: 90+/100 (A grade)
- **Critical Issues**: 0 ESLint errors, 80%+ test coverage
- **Documentation**: 80%+ JSDoc coverage
- **Performance**: Multiple optimization patterns detected

### **Self-Improvement Commands:**
```bash
# Before every change
npx codefortify score --verbose
npx codefortify prompt --focus "code-quality" --context "fixing-issues"

# During development
npx codefortify score --realtime
npx codefortify enhance [file] --target 95 --iterations 3

# After every change
npx codefortify score --verbose
npx codefortify status
npx codefortify estimate
```

### **Current Status:**
- **Score**: 75/100 (C grade) - TARGET: 90+/100 (A grade)
- **Critical Issues**: 196 ESLint errors, 21% test coverage
- **Enhancement Status**: ACTIVE - Continuous self-improvement in progress
